//! Node implementations for the Stoat editor
//!
//! This module will contain concrete node implementations that can be used
//! in the workspace. Each node type will implement the `Node` trait defined in
//! the parent `node` module.
//!
//! Currently empty, ready for new node implementations that align with the
//! text editor vision.
